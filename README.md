GrowlTunesPlugin is a plugin for iTunes that allows you to painfully get Growl notifications from iTunes on track changes. You install the plugin into ~/Library/iTunes/iTunes Plug-ins and launch iTunes, it does have a rough preferences window that lets you configure the format of the notifications, configure a global hotkey to replay the track information and various other user requested settings.
